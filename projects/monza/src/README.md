# 🧩 Monza UI

**Monza UI** is a lightweight, modern Angular component library built on top of  
the Monza design system. Fast, expressive, and beautiful — designed to help you build  
consistent interfaces with minimal effort.

This package contains all standalone Angular UI components, fully typed and powered by the  
Monza SCSS Tokens + Utilities.

Pair it with:

- **Monza Styles** (recommended)  
- Angular apps (standalone-based)  
- Any new Angular 17+ project  
- Lightweight front-end environments that want clean, structured UI

> **Make sure your global styles import Monza Styles first:**
>
> ```scss
> @use "monza/styles" as mon;
> ```
